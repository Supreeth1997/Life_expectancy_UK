# Life Expectancy Analysis in the UK  

This repository contains an analysis of life expectancy across the United Kingdom, highlighting how socioeconomic factors such as income, deprivation, and access to healthcare contribute to disparities. The project aims to inform public health policies and promote equitable outcomes by leveraging data-driven insights.  

## Project Objectives  
1. Examine the correlation between life expectancy and indicators of low-income families.  
2. Identify geographic disparities in life expectancy within the UK.  
3. Assess how poverty-related factors, such as unemployment, influence life expectancy.  
4. Propose actionable interventions to address these disparities.  

## Data Sources  
The analysis integrates datasets from:  
- **Fingertips**  
- **UK Office for National Statistics (ONS)**  
- **National Health Service (NHS)**  

Data spans the past 10 years and includes geographic identifiers for local-level analysis.  

## Methodology  
The analysis employs:  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Initial examination and cleaning of datasets.  
- **Statistical Modeling**: Regression, ANOVA, and Chi-Square tests to evaluate relationships between variables.  
- **Visualization**: Heatmaps, scatterplots, and interactive maps for geographic insights.  
- **Clustering**: Segmentation of areas based on life expectancy and related indicators.  

## Key Findings  
- **Income Disparities**: Higher income correlates positively with increased life expectancy.  
- **Regional Inequality**: A pronounced north-south divide, with southern areas outperforming northern regions.  
- **Deprivation**: Strong negative correlation (-0.91) with life expectancy.  
- **Alcohol and Unemployment**: High mortality and unemployment rates significantly lower life expectancy.  

## Recommendations  
1. **Healthcare Investments**: Increase resources in high-deprivation areas like Blackpool and Kingston upon Hull.  
2. **Economic Development**: Implement job creation and skills training programs.  
3. **Community Support**: Promote addiction services, healthy food access, and recreation facilities.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas`  
  - `matplotlib`  
  - `seaborn`  
  - `statsmodels`  
  - `folium`  
  - `sklearn`  

## Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
- Python 3.8 or above  
- Required Python libraries (`requirements.txt` available in the repo)  

## Future Enhancements  
- Temporal analysis of trends over decades.  
- Inclusion of additional variables like education and environmental factors.  
- Advanced machine learning models for predictive analysis.
